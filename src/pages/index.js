        <h2>A book by Ben Junya</h2>
        <p>
          Modern Javascript by Example is a free and open-source book created by me,
          <a href="https://www.github.com/MrBenJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ben Junya </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Javascript moves fast, really really fast. By the time you take the first sip of coffee this morning, Javascript has already smashed the accelerator pedal down so far, it went through the chassis and Pluto has been colonized by Node version 14. Every step you take, a new patched verion of Node is released, and four new frameworks have been invented. No pressure to keep up, right?
        </p>
        <p>
          All joking aside, the language that was once seen as a weird-ish toy language is used to build beautiful user interfaces, do automated tasks, and deliver web content at blazing fast speeds. Javascript is here to stay, and the evolution of the language and its quirky properties will continue as time goes on.
