## A Book by Ben Junya

Modern Javascript by Example is a free and open-source book created by me, [Ben Junya](https://www.github.com/mrbenj).

Javascript moves fast, really really fast. By the time you take the first sip of coffee this morning, Javascript has already smashed the accelerator pedal down so far, it went through the chassis and Pluto has been colonized by Node version 14. Every step you take, a new patched verion of Node is released, and four new frameworks have been invented. No pressure to keep up, right?

All joking aside, the language that was once seen as a weird-ish toy language is used to build beautiful user interfaces, do automated tasks, and deliver web content at blazing fast speeds. Javascript is here to stay, and the evolution of the language and its quirky properties will continue as time goes on.

## About the Book

Modern Javascript by Example includes:

* Tons of code examples that explain themselves.
* Focus on high quality examples and pragmatic knowledge.
* Absolutely terrible humor

This book is available **offline** - so save it to your **bookmarks** for offline viewing :).
