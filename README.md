### A Practical and Example filled book about good ol' JavaScript
#### Written by Ben Junya [@MrBenJ](https://www.github.com/MrBenJ)

JavaScript doesn't just move fast, it smashed the accelerator down so hard it went through the chassis of the car and already colonized Pluto before your instant noodles finished cooking.

This open source free to read and consume book is meant for beginner to intermediate programmers looking to use all the brand new features of JavaScript with real-world pragmatic examples that are easy to use and fun to implement in your own project.

**This book is a work in progress and will continue to be updated and worked on regularly**.
