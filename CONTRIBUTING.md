Contributing
============

## Thank You!

Thank you for your consideration in helping make Modern JavaScript by Example the best book ever!
  
To me, this book is really a labor of love, and by you being here wanting to help make it better, I'm all the more appreciative and thankful that you're here.

## Guidelines

1. Please see the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](code-of-conduct) for the general guidelines on contributing and policies.

2. Any size pull request is welcome, whether it's a full new chapter, or just a few small typo fixes here and there.

3. If there's a specific topic with a strong opinion about JavaScript, it shouldn't be vocalized in the book. This book is overall meant to be agnostic and not delve into strong opinionated decisions when it comes to the language. Examples of this type of behavior includes, but is not limited to:
  * Use of semicolons.
  * Style (tab/spaces, indentation rules, newline style, etc).
  * Why framework ABC is better than XYZ.
  * Why library x is wonderful or terrible.
  
## Things We're ALWAYS Looking For

* **Examples**! - I titled the book "... by Example" for a reason! If you have more examples and other things to show.

* **Proofreading** - I (Ben Junya) am not perfect at the English language, despite being a native speaker and writer. Please feel free to submit any small PR's fixing grammar or writing syntax errors.

* **Interesting Stuff** - Find something interesting in the fast moving JavaScript catamaran? Jump in and make a PR! This is subject to my own accord and may or may not get merged in. However, if something new is written and your content is referenced, I will certainly attribute credit and give you the content in order for you to make a PR and get recognized.

This book is meant to be a resource for all developers, and open to anyone jumping in and making it a great resource for everyone, so if you find sections you really feel need improvement, jump in! This book is just as much mine as it is yours ;).

## Before Creating Your PR...

1. Make sure `npm test` runs fine. I'm using [Alex](alex) to catch any accidental inconsiderate writing in the book. CircleCI runs the same task as well, and makes sure a commit is safe before the site is updated.

2. Write a description of **why** these changes are necessary in your pull request. This can be as simple as, "Fixed typo" or "Proofreading."

3. If you are a first time contributor, add your name and what you've done to **Contributors** section in the [README.md](readme). Additionally, if you are contributing again, go ahead and add additional info to your shoutout :).
